    """
    This function generates a signal based on the input parameters.
    It calculates the signal either over time (if is_time_fixed is True) 
    or over distance (if is_time_fixed is False).

    Parameters:
    - A: Amplitude of the signal
    - f: Frequency of the signal
    - phi: Phase of the signal
    - fixed_value: The fixed value (time or distance depending on is_time_fixed)
    - is_time_fixed: A boolean indicating whether the fixed value is time (True) or distance (False)
    - points: The number of points in the generated signal

    Returns:
    - A list of signal values over the specified domain (time or distance)
